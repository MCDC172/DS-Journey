# London Shared Bike Rides 

Hi, in this project I created a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRidesvisualizationprojectfromKaggleDataset/Dashboard1?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
where you can visualize some of the relevant aspects found in [this dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset).

The Dashboard is divided in three main sections:
1. number of total bike rides
2. interactive graph <i>(where you select the time period of your choice)</i>
3. a heat map <i>(Temperature vs Wind Speed)</i>

<sub>(Barplots with the weather and hour of time available when you move the cursor over the heat map and in the lighten section of the interactive graph)</sub>

The data cleaning and formatting done for this project <i>(using python)</i> is in the file `london_bikes`.
