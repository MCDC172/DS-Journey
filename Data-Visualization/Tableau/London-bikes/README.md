# ðŸš´ London Shared Bike Rides 

> ## What variables affect the frequency of use of shared bikes in London?

Hi, have you ever wondered if the current weather, the hour of the day or other factor determines the total of people that use a bike for everyday transportation? Well, if not, here you have a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LondonBikeRidesvisualizationprojectfromKaggleDataset/Dashboard1?:language=es-ES&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
where you can visualize how certain variables influenced the total amount of shared bike rides in London between 2015 and 2017.

The Dashboard is divided in three main sections:
1. number of total bike rides
2. interactive graph <i>(where you select the time period of your choice)</i>
3. a heat map <i>(Temperature vs Wind Speed)</i>

<sub>(Barplots with the weather and hour of time available when you move the cursor over the heat map and in the lighten section of the interactive graph)</sub>
